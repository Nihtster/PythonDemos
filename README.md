# PythonDemos

Contains all of the python projects I've written in the early years of my programming career.

The files have been altered with better naming, but all code within the files are the same as when they were initially created and completed.

## Tech Stack

**Base:** Python

**Libraries:** Turtle Graphics, Tkinter

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the programs showcased in this repository, I learned about
the fundementals of the Python language, and started developing my own programming routines when presented with a task/problem.

I learned the syntax for Python, declarations of variables, logic branches, and code looping. This was where I also began to learn about how to structure and organize the code within each file and where certain methods can appropriately be placed.

## Dependencies

In order to run all of these Python demos, Python and Pip must be installed on your machine.
Pip is used to install some libraries such as Turtle TurtleGraphics and Tkinter (GUI library).

In order to install or check if you have Python installed, please refer to the official documentation
